Python is a Blast! 🎉

This is what I have learned today!
🔹 Data types & Variables: Store different types of data.
🔹 Control Flow: Make decisions with if-else and loops.
🔹 Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries: Organize data like a pro.
🔹 Functions: Use reusable code for tasks.
🔹 Modules: Extend Python’s power with built-in libraries.
